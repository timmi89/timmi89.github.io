<!---about me---->

<div class= "column">
  <h2>a little about me</h2>
  <p>i recently moved to portland from seattle, where i worked for the <em><a href="http://www.spl.org/locations/central-library">downtown public library.</a></em> my position at the library involved wearing many hats which included, but was not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>customer service</li>
    <li>circulation maintence and monitoring</li>
    <li>outreach to homeless communities</li>
    <li>reader's advisory</li>
    <li>account management</li>
  </ul>
  <p>i was propelled to portland by the job change of my gentlefriend, and figured this was my only real chance to develop some of the skills that many libraries lack i.e. web development abilities. which is why i'm here at epicodus. i have <strong>very</strong> little knowledge of coding and am greatful all the help i'm recieving. in my freetime i enjoy hiking, crosswords, photography, singing loudly in the car, dr who, and shaking my fist at squirrels.</p>
